# Digital-clock
This mini project is a simple Digital Clock built using basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript/jQuery. The purpose of the project is to display the current time in a clear and visually appealing format, updating every second without requiring a page refresh.

The project uses HTML to structure the content, CSS to style the clock with a modern look, and JavaScript/jQuery to dynamically update the time using the system clock. A setInterval() function is used to refresh the hour, minute, and second values every 1000 milliseconds, ensuring that the displayed time stays accurate.

This project demonstrates the fundamental concepts of front-end web development such as DOM manipulation, styling, and event timing. It is lightweight, responsive, and works smoothly on all browsers. The digital clock can be enhanced further by adding features like AM/PM format, date display, animations, or theme switching.
